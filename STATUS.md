# Status

**Phase:** 3→4 — Design doc written; entering full build
**Last updated:** 2026-07-02

## Done
- Project plan reviewed and strengthened; foundation files created.
- Environment confirmed: Windows PC, iPhone for testing, no Mac (cloud build required), sprint pace.
- Apple Developer Program: Dan enrolled (2026-07-02).

- Phase 1 research done; concepts chosen: prototype both "Stick the Landing" and "Squeeze."
- Both prototypes built and playtested. **Winner: Stick the Landing** (ragdoll character theme). Squeeze parked as backup.
- STL v2 built: articulated character, ragdoll crashes, particles, hitstop, perfect-streak scoring, synth SFX.

- v2 playtested: loop validated (streaks work, ramp fair, crashes need comedy in build phase).
- DESIGN.md v1 written. Monetization, v1.0 scope, and tech stack decided (see DECISIONS.md). Name TBD.

- Git live: repo "project-x" on Dan's GitHub; GitHub Pages enabled; workflow: Claude edits → Dan commits/pushes in GitHub Desktop.
- iPhone feel-test passed (tap responsive, spin readable; sound = placeholder until themed).
- Theme + name decided: **TAKE 47** (movie stunt set). Theme confirmed in playtest; quips readable.
- Core restructured to **scenes-as-levels** (persisted progress, retry same scene, seeded scene design) in `prototypes/take-47.html`; includes first accessibility setting (reduce motion). Standing a11y/privacy rule added to CLAUDE.md.

## Next steps
1. Dan: push, then play the scene-progression build — does persistent progress feel better than the endless run? Is the per-scene difficulty ramp fair?
2. Phase 4 build: restructure into the real app (menus, unlockable characters, share card, daily challenge = endless seeded run, achievements, settings screen).
3. Icon + real sound design in the movie-set language.
4. Later: verify "TAKE 47" availability when reserving the name in App Store Connect.
